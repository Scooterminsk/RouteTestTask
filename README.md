# 📍 RouteTestTask
Application for building the shortest route for given points.

## 📲 Now let's see how this application works:

Below you can see the start screen of the application, which contains a map and a custom button with the function of adding an address.

After clicking on the "Add address" button, an alert appears on the screen with a text field in which the address is entered. If the address is entered incorrectly, then an alert appears on the screen that processes this error.

  </p>
 </body>

If you enter 3 addresses, then 2 more buttons appear on the screen: "Route" and "Reset". If you click on the "Route" button, the algorithm will determine the shortest route between these three points.

  </p>
 </body>

If you press the "Reset" button, then the entered addresses and the 2 bottom buttons will disappear.
